Notes on antimalarial pharmacovigilance 
And notes from HSA presentation on PV
--A practical handbook on the PV of antimalarial medicines

#Focus on PV instead of the drug

1. Introduction: 
  PV is science and activity of detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of drug related ADR
  drug do harm patients sometimes
  
  *In Singapore, MOH is covering general public health and HSA covers regulartory and monitorning. projects initialed by MUH.
  ADR is unintended effect, dont include over doses and poisoning.
  ALL drugs have risks as well as benefits.
  
2. Passive and active pharmacovigilance
  Active: follow up, cohort event monitorinng(CEM)(eg below), use EMR
  eg: IMMP in New Zealand and PEM in England.(look up)
  
3. reasons for PV
 - difference of clinic trials and real world. (eg: Demo, #of users(1500-3000))
  *the # user need for 1/N ratio AE, need 3N to spot a case.
  eg: Thalidomile crisis
  
4. Birth of PV
 - Started 1964
 case eg: Dec2011 Parkistan, cardiac medicine  - heavy bleading . -  reaction from regulators
          2001 Singapore, Statin Rhabdomyolysis recalled - local reports, US infor -> advices -> WHO recalled 
          
5. Role of WHO and UMC
  WHO: Establish PV system and centers for countries, mantain networks, platform for sharing infor
  UMC: To co-codinate WHO monitorning programs (eg:Vigi* programs)
 
6. Factors to consider for building national PV center 
  - designated staff, fundings, well definied structure and roles
  - natioanl SRS: reporting form(ICSR) or management system(VigiFlow)
  - Database
  - Advisory committee
  
7. Singapore's Experience
 - Partnors: specialist in specific fields, internal partners
 
8. Stakeholders in PV:
  - Healthcare professionals: Doctors, phamacists, nurses, allied health(Singapore: doctors and phamacists)
  - Patients and the publics:NA for SG
  - Government: HSA PV works are using MOH PH care fund
  
 *How to use data to demonstrate PV cost-saving??
  -Multi-institutional multi-source data, hard to access. 
 
 9. Phamacovigilance framework 1,2,3,4,5,6
  -legislation -> Regulation ->guideline(documents avaliable in HSA website)
  
 10. SF pharmaceuticals products. 
  - Missing active PC ingredients products(None ingredients) - also require for regulations and monitorning
  - case eg: in 2008 SG, Power 1 sexual enhancement tablet. Include over amount of anti diebates ingredients
